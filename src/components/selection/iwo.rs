/// Selects individuals deterministically proportional to their fitness.

/// Originally proposed for, and used as selection in [`iwo`].
///
/// Each individual gets selected between `min_selected` and `max_selected` times:
/// - The worst solution gets selected exactly `min_selected` times.
/// - The best solution gets selected exactly `max_selected` times.
/// - All solutions between them get selected based on the linear interpolation
///   between `min_selected` and `max_selected`.
///
/// [`iwo`]: crate::heuristics::iwo
///
/// # Deviation from the Reference
///
/// If all individuals have the same fitness value, they will all be considered average and receive a 50% bonus.
/// This case has not been accounted for in the reference paper.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns an `Err` if the population contains individuals with infinite objective value.
