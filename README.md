# MAHF

A framework for modular construction and evaluation of meta-heuristics.

# Requirements

- [The Rust Programming Language](https://rust-lang.org)
- [An R Envrionment](https://www.r-project.org/) (Only for the evaluation)

# Documentation

Just run
```sh
$ cargo doc --open
```
to build and open the documentation.

# Examples

The [`mahf_demo`](./examples/mahf_demo.rs) example illustrates how this
framework can be used to evaluate IWO and (μ+λ)-ES as well as the influence of their
components on the optimization process.
